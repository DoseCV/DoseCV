# DoseCV
DoseCV is a software created to facilitate the dose conversion process in simulations carried out using MCNP 6.X and the ICRP Publication 145 reference phantoms in scientific and educational simulations. This software is not compatible with all types of simulations and scenarios, so it is up to the user to determine if the software applies to the situation in which it will be used. All output data must be analyzed critically. Its use is free for study and academic research, and any commercial use is prohibited.
